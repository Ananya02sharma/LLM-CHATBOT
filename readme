## How It Works
# 1 Data Extraction:

Fetches content from Politics of India - Wikipedia.
Extracts headings, paragraphs, lists, and other relevant text.
# 2 Text Embedding:

Converts the extracted text into vectors using SentenceTransformer.
# 3 Vector Indexing:

Uses FAISS to create an index of the vectors for efficient search and retrieval.
# 4 Chatbot Interaction:

Embeds the user's query and searches for relevant content in the FAISS index.
Utilizes the Groq API to generate a response based on the retrieved context

You will need a Groq API key. Replace the placeholder API key in the ChatBot class with your actual key.
You can modify the url in the script to use a different website if needed.
